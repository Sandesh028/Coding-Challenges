# Chal 1: Objective: Write a Python program that performs the following tasks
## Generate a List of Random Numbers: Create a list containing 15 random integers between 1 and 100. (Hint: Use the random module's randint function.)
- Filter the List: Create a new list that only contains numbers from the original list that are divisible by 5.
- Sort the Filtered List: Sort this new list in descending order.
- Sum and Average: Calculate and print the sum and the average of the numbers in the sorted, filtered list.

# Chal 2: Problem Statement: Word Lengths in Sentences
 Objective: Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

- Input a Sentence: Ask the user to input a sentence.
- Split the Sentence into Words: Break the sentence into individual words.
- Calculate the Length of Each Word: For each word in the sentence, calculate its length.
- Store Word Lengths: Create a dictionary where each key is a word from the sentence, and its value is the length of that word.
- Find the Longest Word(s): Identify the longest word or words in the sentence (as there might be more than one word of the same maximum length).
## Output the Results: Print the dictionary of word lengths, and then print the longest word or words along with their length.
